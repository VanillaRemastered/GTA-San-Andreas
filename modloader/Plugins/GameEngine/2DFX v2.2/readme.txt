A set of plugins for GTA SA, which increases generic objects draw distance, adds LOD corona effects, allows to use a big farClip in timecyc without crashes and fixes flickering issue.

Installation:
You need Silent's ASI Loader from here - http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=21709
and San Andreas Mod Loader from here - http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25377
Paste 'scripts' and 'modloader' folders from archive to GTA SA root directory(or 'Project_2dfx_sa' to 'modloader').
If you're not using Mod Loader, then you need to import DFF files from 'modloader\Project_2dfx_sa' to 'models\gta3.img'.

In case you are updating this mod from any 1.x version, don't forget to uninstall 1.x first.
