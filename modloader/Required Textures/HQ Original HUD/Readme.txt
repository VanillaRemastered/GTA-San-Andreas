Original Radar Icons in HQ. Made by Quantum. 2015.

- The idea was to remake original radar icons (and some other stuff from hud.txd) in high quality as close as possible to the original look.

- To install, I recommend using Mod Loader - http://gtaforums.com/topic/669520-sarel-mod-loader/

Create a folder (name it whatever you like) in modloader section and simply place hud.txd in there. Done. 
Or you can replace hud.txd in "models" folder, but don't forget to backup original hud.txd, just in case.

- For better experience I recommend using my icons with High Quality Radar from mobile SA. You can download it here - http://gtaforums.com/topic/661961-sa-mobile-to-pc-research-project/

- *The fist icon is from Android San Andreas.

Enjoy.
